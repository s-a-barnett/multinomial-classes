This is a (potentially non-exhaustive) list of features I would like to add to this project:

1. Introduce class of non-commutative polynomials in d-variables, with the same features as the commutative class.

2. Add 'representation' functions that produces a string showing you which polynomial corresponds to which array.

3. Add error messages for wrongly-inputted coefficient arrays (i.e., arrays not of the shape (n+1, ..., n+1) for some n).
